# full-stack-week-one
This is going to be the first full stack project for the new cohort

By the end of the week, you will have a fully functioning, mini application.

Day one - git, HTML, and CSS

Today will be spent incorporating what you have learned about git, HTML, and CSS.


Git

The first step will be to fork this repo, and clone it onto your own machine.

the command line code is:
git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusernamehere>/full-stack-week-one.git

The folder containing the project currently contains only two files, the .gitignore and README.md.
We need to create a few files. The first file is the index.html. Then, create two directories.
Name one styles and the other js. Inside the styles folder, create a style.css file.
Inside the js folder, create an app.js file. The file structure should look like this:
